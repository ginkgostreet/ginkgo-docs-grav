# Ginkgo Street "Labs"

A Lab is a project nexus for all Stakeholders and Implementors to have a meeting of the minds, quickly find resources and knowledge, and quickly gain perspective on where we've been, and where we are going.

This Lab is the Lab Lab. It documents the features in a Lab, and hosts the project to develop the features of Labs. It will hopefully also remain a prime example of a Lab and contain the documentation for on-boarding users of Labs.
