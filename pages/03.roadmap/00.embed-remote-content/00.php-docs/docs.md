# PHP Docs

D-R-Y

We should generate documentation (feature solutions) from source code.

Is this really a Lab feature? Advantage to generating and importing the docs in grav is we will have a snapshot of a particular version in the lab.
Disadvantage is perhaps duplicating the documentation that might be in the repo already, grav getting out of sync, and bloat of the files in the lab.
