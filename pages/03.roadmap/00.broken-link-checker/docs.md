# Broken Link Checker

## Options

http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/

https://github.com/jgonyea/grav-plugin-broken-link-checker

## Discussion - Tool Selection

The grav plugin will obviously "work" with our grav sites. However, it is rather incomplete. It does only static analysis of links, so links generated by twig are not caught. It is not clear from 5 seconds of research if it checks external links, or just links internal to the site.

The python utility has not one, but **three** UI's. GUI, CLI, and Web. CLI sounds ideal to this dev, wanting to validate before pushing changes to the repo.

## Discussion - Automattion

 with GitHooks?

RTFM Server cron-job?

dunno.

## Discussion - Other Features?

Ensure canonical URL is set?

Other validation?

## TODO

Add the broken link checker plugin into the default install profile.

Document it's usage.
