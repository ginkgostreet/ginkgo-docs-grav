# Feature

A Feature is a functional unit that is a contract that ensures that stakeholders and collaborators of a product project share a common understanding. 

Features provide a common repository for all types of documentation. A Feature is created as the initial step of any project, and persists indefinitely, recording history, status, and comprehensive definitions.
