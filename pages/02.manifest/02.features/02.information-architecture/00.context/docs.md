# Context for Lab Information Architecture

## Personas
 - **End User**: user looking for guidance on using the solution
 - **Stakeholder**: and invested user of the solution that articulates organization processes
 - **Project Owner**: arbiter between a development team and stakeholders
 - **System Administrator**: a user making changes to the system (deployed solution)
 - **Architect**: A designer of solutions: translates requirements into mockups, proposals, or specifications.
 - **Technical Lead**: technically assures the solution and oversees development tools and processes.
 - **Implementor**: builds features that make up the solution

## Terms
 - **Roadmap**: the un-built or under-development solution, made up of Features.
 - **Feature**: A Roadmap and System unit. Features have a standardized document structure and are conceived in the Roadmap. The only required aspects of a feature, are its Context and Solution. A feature starts with a Context and ends with a Solution, but both should evolve throughout the feature lifecycle.
 - **Context**: Everything that exists outside of a feature that help to define a feature. Interactions, Interfaces, Users, Services, Processes, Concepts...
 - **Discussion**: a workspace for the development of features
 - **Discovery**: Accepted and Verified facts. Documentation of discovery process is NOT part of  Discovery, and belongs in Discussion.
 - **Solution**: within a feature, the articulated blueprint or approach to implementing a feature specification. Competing or component solutions will exist in a Feature in discussion or discovery areas. When a feature enters development, the Solution is understood to be validated and complete and specially designated within the file structure of the feature.
 - **The Solution**: the system in fact or abstractly, the collection of features.
 - **System**: the whole of the solution in production and described in the Manifest.
 - **Guides**: step-by-step how-to instructions for any type of user.
 - **Manifest**: A declaration of the deployed system components and status.

## Primary Use-Cases 
### An End User is unsure how to complete a task

### A Project Owner identifies un-met needs of the system

### An Architect provides constraints to implementors

### An Implementor builds a feature

### A System Administrator deploys a feature or feature update

### An Architect or Owner documents a process with flow diagrams

### An Architect mocks-up a User Interface design

### A Technical Architect creates technical diagrams or functional specifications.

### A Project Owner performs acceptance testing

### A Project Owner initializes a Project Lab and marshalls resources.
